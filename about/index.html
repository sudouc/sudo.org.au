				<h4>Helping developers build products, not programs.</h4>
				<p>Here at Sudo, we believe in going the extra mile. Coding your game or app doesn’t stop when you’ve showed your friends or co-workers, it continues well on into development and into the App Store.</p> 
				<p>We’re so committed to ongoing development, we offer members the chance to pitch their idea or project to be developed by every member.</p>
